## Types

### SkipRestriction

The advertisement skip restriction.

Applies to fast-forward/rewind (e.g. trick mode), seeking over an entire opportunity (e.g. jump), seeking out of what's currently playing, and "Skip this ad..." features. Seeking over multiple ad opportunities only requires playback of the _last_ opportunity, not all opportunities, preceding the seek destination.

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
